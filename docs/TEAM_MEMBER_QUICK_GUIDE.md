# Team Member Quick Guide
## Your Cheat Sheet for Working on the School Game Together!

Welcome to the team, Conan Jr and Neo! You're now official game developers!
This guide will help you work together with Conan and Carlos to build something amazing.

Think of this guide like a recipe book - whenever you forget how to do something, just look here!

## What Are These Tools?

Before we start, here's what each tool does:

| Tool | What It's Like | What It Does |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Google Drive | A magic backpack in the cloud | Stores all our game files so everyone can get them |
| Discord | A walkie-talkie for the team | Lets us chat, share ideas, and ask for help |
| Trello | A quest board in an RPG | Shows all the tasks (quests!) and who's doing what |

---

# Part 1: Using Google Drive

## What is Google Drive?

Google Drive is like a **magic storage chest in the sky** that everyone on the team can open!

Instead of the game files being stuck on just one computer, we keep them in the cloud
so anyone can grab the latest version anytime.

---

## How to DOWNLOAD the Latest Game Version

### When do I do this?
**Before you start working!** Always grab the freshest version so you have everyone's latest changes.

### Step-by-Step Recipe:

```
Step 1: Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

Step 2: Go to drive.google.com

Step 3: Sign in with your Google account (if you're not already signed in)

Step 4: Look for the folder called "School Madness" or whatever Conan named it
        Click on it to open it!

Step 5: Find the game files you need
        (Usually the whole project folder)

Step 6: Right-click on the folder

Step 7: Click "Download"
        The folder will download as a .zip file (a compressed package)

Step 8: Find the downloaded .zip file (usually in your Downloads folder)

Step 9: Right-click the .zip file and select "Extract All" or "Unzip"

Step 10: Now you have the latest game files! Open them in RPG Maker MZ!
```

### Pro Tip!
Always save the extracted folder somewhere you'll remember, like a "GameDev" folder on your Desktop!

### Your Screen Should Look Like This:
```
+------------------------------------------+
|  Google Drive                            |
|  +------------------------------------+  |
|  | SchoolGame                    [v]  |  |
|  |   > Maps                           |  |
|  |   > Characters                     |  |
|  |   > Scripts                        |  |
|  |   > Audio                          |  |
|  +------------------------------------+  |
|                                          |
|  Right-click the folder to see:          |
|  +------------------+                    |
|  | Download         | <-- Click this!    |
|  | Share            |                    |
|  | Rename           |                    |
|  +------------------+                    |
+------------------------------------------+
```

## How to UPLOAD Your Work

### When do I do this?
**After you finish working!** Share your awesome creations with the team!

### Important Rule!
Before uploading, **always tell the team on Discord** that you're about to upload!
This prevents two people from uploading at the same time and getting confused.

### Step-by-Step Recipe:

```
Step 1: Save your work in RPG Maker MZ
        (File > Save Project or press Ctrl + S)

Step 2: Open Google Drive in your browser (drive.google.com)

Step 3: Navigate to the SchoolGame folder

Step 4: Look at what you changed:
        - Did you make a new map? Go to the Maps folder
        - Did you make a new character? Go to the Characters folder
        - Not sure? Ask on Discord!

Step 5: Click the "+ New" button (top left corner)

Step 6: Click "File upload" or "Folder upload"
        (Folder upload if you have multiple files)

Step 7: Find the files you changed on your computer and select them

Step 8: Wait for the upload to finish
        (You'll see a progress bar)

Step 9: Tell the team on Discord: "I uploaded [what you changed]!"
```

### Your Upload Screen Should Look Like This:
```
+------------------------------------------+
|  Google Drive                            |
|  +--------+                              |
|  | + New  | <-- Click this button!       |
|  +--------+                              |
|      |                                   |
|      v                                   |
|  +------------------+                    |
|  | New folder       |                    |
|  | File upload      | <-- For one file   |
|  | Folder upload    | <-- For many files |
|  +------------------+                    |
+------------------------------------------+
```

### Don't Forget!
If you're replacing a file that already exists, Google Drive will ask if you want to replace it.
Click "Replace" if you're sure your version is the newest!

# Part 2: Using Discord

## What is Discord?

Discord is like a **super-powered walkie-talkie** for our team!

We use it to:
- Chat about the game
- Share ideas and pictures
- Ask for help when stuck
- Celebrate when something cool works!

---

## How to Check for Messages

### Step-by-Step Recipe:

```
Step 1: Open the Discord app (or go to discord.com in your browser)

Step 2: Look at the left side - find our team server
        It might have a picture or just letters

Step 3: Click on it!

Step 4: Look for any channels with a WHITE circle next to them
        That means there are new messages!

Step 5: Click the channel to read the messages

Step 6: Read from where you left off
        (Discord remembers where you stopped)
```

### What the Screen Looks Like:
```
+------------------------------------------+

|          |                 |             |
|  [Team]  |  # general      |  Carlos:    |
|   ^^^    |  # game-ideas   |  "Hey team!"|
|  Click   |  # help-needed  |             |
|  this!   |  # show-off     |  Conan:       |
|          |      ^^^        |  "Nice map!"|
|          |  Channels!      |             |
+------------------------------------------+
```

---

## How to Send a Message

### Step-by-Step Recipe:

```
Step 1: Click on the channel where you want to talk
        (Example: #game-ideas for sharing ideas)

Step 2: Click the text box at the bottom of the screen
        It says something like "Message #channel-name"

Step 3: Type your message!

Step 4: Press Enter on your keyboard to send it
        (Or click the arrow button)
```

### Pro Tips for Good Messages:

**Be Clear!**
```
Good:  "I finished the school hallway map!"
Not Great: "done"
```

**Ask Good Questions!**
```
Good:  "How do I make a door that leads to another room?"
Not Great: "help"
```

---

## How to Share a Picture or Screenshot

Sometimes you want to show the team something cool you made!

### Step-by-Step Recipe:

```
Step 1: Take a screenshot in RPG Maker MZ
        Press the Print Screen button on your keyboard
        OR use the Snipping Tool (search for it on Windows)

Step 2: In Discord, click the + button next to the message box

Step 3: Click "Upload a File"

Step 4: Find your screenshot and select it

Step 5: Add a message explaining what it is
        Example: "Here's the new classroom I made!"

Step 6: Press Enter or click Send!
```

### What the Upload Button Looks Like:
```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  Message Box                                      |
|  +--------------------------------------------+  |
|  | [+]  Type your message here...         [>] |  |
|  +--------------------------------------------+  |
|    ^^^                                           |
|    Click this to upload pictures!                |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

## How to Ask for Help

Stuck on something? That's totally normal! Here's how to ask for help:

### Step-by-Step Recipe:

```
Step 1: Go to the #help-needed channel (or whatever it's called)

Step 2: Write a message that explains:
        - What you're trying to do
        - What's happening instead
        - What you already tried

Step 3: If you can, add a screenshot!

Step 4: Send it and wait for someone to help
        (Be patient - people might be busy!)
```

### Example of a GREAT Help Request:
```
"I'm trying to make an NPC walk to the door, but they just
stand still. I used Set Movement Route but nothing happens.
Here's a screenshot of my event settings. What am I doing wrong?"
```

### Example of a Not-Great Help Request:
```
"it doesnt work"
```

See the difference? The first one helps people help YOU!

# Part 3: Using Trello

## What is Trello?

Trello is like a **Quest Board** in an RPG village!

You know how in video games there's sometimes a board where you can see
all the available quests? Trello is exactly like that!

Each task is like a quest card, and you can:
- See all the quests available
- Pick up quests (claim them as yours)
- Move quests to "Done" when you finish them

---

## Understanding the Board

Our Trello board has different columns (called "lists"):

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        TRELLO BOARD                               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                   |
|  TO DO         |  IN PROGRESS    |  TESTING      |  DONE!        |
|  (Quest Board) |  (Working On)   |  (Checking)   |  (Victory!)   |
|                |                 |               |               |
|  [Make map]    |  [NPC dialogs]  |  [Boss fight] |  [Title screen]
|  [Add music]   |                 |               |  [Menu design]|
|  [Draw sprite] |                 |               |               |
|                |                 |               |               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**TO DO** = Quests waiting for a hero (that's you!)
**IN PROGRESS** = Quests someone is working on right now
**TESTING** = Finished work that needs to be checked
**DONE!** = Completed quests - celebration time!

---

## How to See Your Assigned Tasks

### Step-by-Step Recipe:

```
Step 1: Open Trello (trello.com) in your browser

Step 2: Sign in with your account

Step 3: Find and click on our game's board

Step 4: Look for cards with YOUR face/icon on them
        These are YOUR quests!

Step 5: Click on a card to see the full details:
        - What you need to do
        - Any helpful notes
        - The due date (if there is one)
```

### What Your Quest Card Looks Like:
```
+--------------------------------+
|  Make the Library Map          |  <-- Quest title
+--------------------------------+
|                                |
|  Description:                  |
|  Create a cozy library room    |
|  with bookshelves and tables   |
|                                |
|  Checklist:                    |
|  [ ] Draw the room layout      |
|  [ ] Add bookshelves           |
|  [ ] Add tables and chairs     |
|  [ ] Test that player can walk |
|                                |
|  Assigned to: [Neo's picture]  |
|  Due: December 15              |

## How to Start Working on a Task

Step 2: Click and HOLD on the card

Step 3: Drag it over to the IN PROGRESS column

        This tells the team you're working on it

Step 6: (Optional) Click the card and add a comment like:
        "Starting this now!"
```

### What Dragging Looks Like:
```
Before:
  TO DO              IN PROGRESS
  [Your Quest]  -->  (empty)

  (empty)            [Your Quest]

# Part 4: Being an Awesome Team Member

## The Super Squad Rules

Working on a team is like being in a superhero squad - everyone has to work together!
Here are the rules that make our team UNSTOPPABLE:

---

### Rule 1: Communicate, Communicate, Communicate!

```
+------------------------------------------+
|           THE COMMUNICATION RULE          |
+------------------------------------------+
|                                          |
|  Before you start working:               |
|  "Hey team, I'm about to work on         |
|   the library map!"                      |
|                                          |
|  When you're done:                       |
|  "I finished and uploaded the            |
|   library map to Google Drive!"          |
|                                          |
|  When you're stuck:                      |
|  "Can someone help me with the           |
|   door event? I'm confused."             |
|                                          |
+------------------------------------------+
```

**Why?** So we don't accidentally work on the same thing and waste time!

---

### Rule 2: Always Get the Latest Version First

```
+------------------------------------------+
|           THE FRESH FILES RULE           |
+------------------------------------------+
|                                          |
|  BEFORE you open RPG Maker:              |
|                                          |
|  1. Check Discord - any new updates?     |
|  2. Download latest from Google Drive    |
|  3. THEN start working                   |
|                                          |
|  This prevents your changes from         |
|  erasing someone else's work!            |
|                                          |
+------------------------------------------+
```

**Why?** If you use old files, you might accidentally undo someone else's hard work!

---

### Rule 3: Small Bites, Not Big Chunks

```
+------------------------------------------+
|            THE SMALL BITES RULE          |
+------------------------------------------+
|                                          |
|  DON'T try to do everything at once!     |
|                                          |
|  GOOD: "Today I'll just make             |
|         one classroom map"               |
|                                          |
|  NOT GOOD: "Today I'll make              |
|         ALL the school maps!"            |
|                                          |
|  Smaller tasks = easier to finish        |
|                = easier to fix if wrong  |
|                = more celebrations!      |
|                                          |
+------------------------------------------+
```

**Why?** It's easier to stay focused and not get overwhelmed!

---

### Rule 4: Test Your Work

```
+------------------------------------------+
|            THE PLAYTEST RULE             |
+------------------------------------------+
|                                          |
|  Before saying "I'm done!":              |
|                                          |
|  1. Save your project                    |
|  2. Click Play Test (or press F12)       |
|  3. Walk around and try everything       |
|  4. Does it work? Great, you're done!    |
|  5. Found a problem? Fix it first!       |
|                                          |
+------------------------------------------+
```

**Why?** It's better to find bugs yourself than have someone else find them!

---

### Rule 5: Be Kind and Patient

```
+------------------------------------------+
|            THE KINDNESS RULE             |
+------------------------------------------+
|                                          |
|  Everyone makes mistakes - that's OK!    |
|                                          |
|  If someone breaks something:            |
|  "No worries! Let's fix it together."    |
|                                          |
|  If you break something:                 |
|  "Oops! I made a mistake. Can            |
|   someone help me fix it?"               |
|                                          |
|  If someone does something cool:         |
|  "Wow, that looks amazing!"              |
|                                          |
+------------------------------------------+
```

**Why?** A happy team makes better games!

---

### Rule 6: Ask Questions!

```
+------------------------------------------+
|            THE QUESTIONS RULE            |
+------------------------------------------+
|                                          |
|  There are NO dumb questions!            |
|                                          |
|  If you don't understand something,      |
|  ASK! Conan and Carlos are here to help.   |
|                                          |
|  Asking questions helps you learn        |
|  faster and avoid mistakes.              |
|                                          |
|  "Can you explain how switches work?"    |
|  "What folder should I save this in?"    |
|  "How do I make an NPC move?"            |
|                                          |
+------------------------------------------+
```

**Why?** Asking questions = learning faster = becoming a better game maker!

## Troubleshooting: What If Things Go Wrong?

### "I accidentally deleted something!"

```
Don't panic! Here's what to do:
1. DON'T save the project
2. Close RPG Maker WITHOUT saving
3. Download the latest version from Google Drive
4. That deleted thing should be back!
5. Tell the team what happened so they can help
```

### "Two people worked on the same thing!"

```
This happens sometimes! Here's the fix:
1. Stop and talk on Discord
2. Figure out whose version is better (or combine them!)
3. One person uploads the final version
4. The other person downloads it
5. Add a rule to prevent it next time
```

### "I can't figure out how to do something!"

```
You have options:
1. Check this guide!
2. Ask on Discord in #help-needed
3. Ask Conan or Carlos for a video call explanation
4. Take a break and try again later with fresh eyes
```

### "I'm bored with my task!"

```
It's OK to feel that way sometimes! Try:
1. Take a short break (walk around, have a snack)
2. Ask to switch tasks with someone
3. Work on it for just 10 more minutes
4. If still stuck, talk to Conan about it
```
