SCHOOL BUS INTERIOR SEAT LAYOUT EXAMPLE
========================================

This file shows you how to arrange bus seats on your tileset grid.

TILESET GRID LAYOUT (16x16 tiles, each tile is 48x48 pixels):
-------------------------------------------------------------

Legend:
[ST] = Seat Top (back of seat)
[SB] = Seat Bottom (cushion)
[FL] = Floor tile
[WL] = Wall panel
[__] = Empty tile

   Col: 0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14   15
      ________________________________________________________________________________
Row 0: [ST] [ST] [ST] [ST] [FL] [WL] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__]
Row 1: [SB] [SB] [SB] [SB] [FL] [WL] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__]
Row 2: [FL] [FL] [FL] [FL] [FL] [FL] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__]
Row 3: [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__]
Row 4: [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] [__]
      (Rows 5-15: Empty for future use)

EXPLANATION:
-----------

Row 0-1: Four Bus Seat Variations
- Column 0-1: Seat Version 1 (forward-facing, empty)
- Column 2-3: Seat Version 2 (forward-facing, occupied)
- Column 4-5: Seat Version 3 (rear-facing)
- Column 6-7: Seat Version 4 (damaged/worn)

Each seat spans 2 tiles vertically:
- Top tile (Row 0): Seat back
- Bottom tile (Row 1): Seat cushion

Row 2: Support Tiles
- Columns 0-5: Floor pattern variations
  * Use column 0 for main aisle floor
  * Columns 1-5 for variations (dirty, scuffed, etc.)

Row 3-15: Reserved for Future
- Leave empty initially
- Can add later:
  * Dashboard components
  * Windows
  * Door frames
  * More seat variations
  * Decorative elements

VISUAL EXAMPLE OF ONE SEAT (Columns 0-1, Rows 0-1):
--------------------------------------------------

This is what ONE forward-facing bus seat looks like across 2 tiles:

Tile at Row 0, Column 0 (Seat Back - Top):
   ________________________________________
  |                                        |
  |    ╔════════════════════════════╗     |
  |    ║                            ║     | ← Seat back
  |    ║    HEADREST AREA           ║     |
  |    ║                            ║     |
  |    ║                            ║     |
  |    ╚════════════════════════════╝     |
  |________________________________________|

Tile at Row 1, Column 0 (Seat Cushion - Bottom):
   ________________________________________
  |    ╔════════════════════════════╗     |
  |    ║                            ║     | ← Cushion
  |    ║      SEAT CUSHION          ║     |
  |    ║                            ║     |
  |    ╚════════════════════════════╝     |
  |     \_________________________/       | ← Shadow/base
  |________________________________________|

SIMPLE DRAWING GUIDE:
--------------------

For placeholder quality:
1. Use rectangles for seat shapes
2. Add simple outline (1-2 pixel black border)
3. Fill with solid color (no gradients needed)
4. Add basic shadow at bottom of cushion
5. Keep it minimal - recognizable is enough!

SEAT TYPES TO CREATE (Priority Order):
-------------------------------------

1. FORWARD-FACING EMPTY SEAT
   - Just the seat structure, no occupant
   - Basic green or blue vinyl color
   - Columns 0-1 on your tileset

2. FORWARD-FACING OCCUPIED SEAT
   - Same seat with simple character silhouette
   - Add basic head/shoulders on seat back
   - Columns 2-3 on your tileset

3. FLOOR TILE
   - Simple repeating pattern
   - Dark gray or black rubber texture
   - Column 4 (and variations in 5-6)

4. WALL PANEL (Optional for v1)
   - Metal bus interior wall
   - Light colored rectangle
   - Column 7

LATER ADDITIONS (NOT NEEDED FOR FIRST VERSION):
----------------------------------------------

- Rear-facing seats
- Damaged seat variations
- Driver's seat
- Dashboard
- Windows
- Emergency exit
- Handrails

HOW THIS WILL BE USED IN-GAME:
-----------------------------

When building the bus interior map in RPG Maker:
1. Place floor tiles first (creates walkable aisle)
2. Place seats in rows along sides
3. Alternate seat directions for variety
4. Set passability (floor = walkable, seats = blocked)

Example bus layout (view from above in RPG Maker):
   ___________________________________
  |  [SEAT] [AISLE] [AISLE] [SEAT]  | ← Row 1
  |  [SEAT] [AISLE] [AISLE] [SEAT]  | ← Row 2
  |  [SEAT] [AISLE] [AISLE] [SEAT]  | ← Row 3
  |  [SEAT] [AISLE] [AISLE] [SEAT]  | ← Row 4
  |  [SEAT] [AISLE] [AISLE] [SEAT]  | ← Row 5
  |  [SEAT] [AISLE] [AISLE] [SEAT]  | ← Row 6
  |___________________________________|

QUICK START MINIMAL TILESET:
---------------------------

Absolute minimum to create a functional bus interior:
☐ 1 forward-facing seat (2 tiles: top + bottom)
☐ 1 floor tile for aisle

That's it! Just 3 tiles total (48x96px seat + 48x48px floor)

This is enough to:
- Build a simple bus interior map
- Place repeating seats
- Have walkable aisle
- Start testing gameplay

You can add variations and details later!

TESTING YOUR LAYOUT:
-------------------

After creating your tileset:
1. Import into RPG Maker MZ
2. Create small test map (10x10 tiles)
3. Place 2-3 seats in a row
4. Place floor between them
5. Walk around in test mode
6. Verify:
   ☐ Seats align properly
   ☐ No gaps between tiles
   ☐ Floor tiles repeat seamlessly
   ☐ Can walk on floor, blocked by seats

If test works, expand to full bus layout!

REMEMBER:
--------

This is a PLACEHOLDER. Quality bar is:
- Recognizable as a bus seat? ✓
- Functions in game? ✓
- Looks professional? NOT REQUIRED FOR V1

Focus on function first, polish later!

Good luck creating your school bus interior!
