## 💡 Key Decisions & Context

### Development Philosophy

2. **Parallel development** - Family 1 (tech) and Family 2 (art) work simultaneously where possible
3. **Regular iteration** - Small commits, frequent testing, continuous feedback
4. **Family-friendly** - Keep it fun, educational, low-pressure

### Workflow Established
1. **Before work:** Run pull-updates.bat, post in Discord
2. **While working:** Save frequently, test often
3. **After work:** Run quick-commit.bat, share in Discord
4. **Coordination:** Only one person in RPG Maker at a time

### First Development Milestone
**Goal:** Playable school bus interior scene
**Definition of done:**
- Bus interior map built and functional
- 12 student NPCs placed in seats
- All NPCs have dialogue
- Player can walk and interact
- Scene is playable start-to-finish

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Success metric:** Both families can play the scene and it's fun!
