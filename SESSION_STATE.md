## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Git Configuration
- **User:** Conan Arturo Aspery
- **Email:** aspery0511@gmail.com
- **Remote:** https://github.com/cpr0duct/school-madness.git
- **Branch:** main
- **Git LFS:** Configured for .png, .jpg, .ogg, .mp3, .webm, .mp4

### Automation Scripts
All scripts are Windows batch files located in repository root:
- `quick-commit.bat` - Stages, commits, and pushes changes
- `pull-updates.bat` - Fetches and pulls latest changes
- `check-status.bat` - Shows current Git status

### Coordination Rules
- ⚠️ Only ONE person can work in RPG Maker MZ at a time
- Always post in Discord #task-coordination before opening RPG Maker
- Always run `pull-updates.bat` before starting work
- Always run `quick-commit.bat` after finishing work

---

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

1. **Using GitHub despite RPG Maker limitations**
   - Strict coordination rules prevent conflicts
   - Automation scripts simplify workflow
   - Git LFS handles large assets

2. **Two-family workflow separation**
   - Family 1: Technical (maps, events, systems)
   - Family 2: Art (sprites, tilesets, UI)
   - Both: Story, dialogue, testing

3. **Tool Stack**
   - GitHub: Version control
   - Discord: Real-time communication
   - Trello: Task management
   - Google Drive: Documentation & backups

4. **First Development Target**
   - School bus interior scene
   - 12 unique student NPCs
   - Serves as tutorial and introduction
