## 🔑 Key Context to Remember

### Important Decisions Made:

1. **Using GitHub despite RPG Maker limitations**
   - Strict coordination rules to prevent conflicts
   - One person in RPG Maker at a time
   - Clear communication in Discord before opening project

2. **Two-family workflow separation**
   - Family 1: Technical work (maps, events, code)
   - Family 2: Art work (sprites, tilesets, UI)
   - Both: Story, dialogue, testing

3. **Game name: "School Madness"**
   - All templates updated with this name
   - First map: School Bus Interior

4. **Kid-friendly approach**
   - Simple guides for kids
   - Tasks labeled as kid-friendly
   - Playtesting role for kids

### User's Constraints:
- Evening/weekend hobby project only
- Two families with day jobs
- Neither family are professional game developers
- Prefer free tools
- Want to work simultaneously when possible

### Tools Already Created by User:
- ✅ Discord server (needs channel setup)
- ✅ Trello account (needs board setup)
- ✅ Switched to default model (Sonnet 4.5)
