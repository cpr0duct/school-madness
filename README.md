# School Madness

A collaborative RPG Maker MZ game developed by two families working together.

## Project Overview

**School Madness** is a family-friendly RPG adventure where players navigate school life, make friends, and experience the chaos of being a student. This project is a collaborative effort between two families learning game development together.

## First Scene: School Bus Interior

Our first map features a school bus interior with 12 unique student NPCs, each with their own personality and dialogue. This serves as the tutorial area where players learn game mechanics.
