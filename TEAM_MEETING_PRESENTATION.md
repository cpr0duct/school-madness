Welcome everyone! This is our official kickoff meeting for School Madness - our two-family collaborative RPG game project. Today we'll cover what we've already set up, what you need to do, and what we're building together.

---

## SLIDE 2: What Is School Madness?

**Title:** What Are We Building?

**Content:**
- **Genre:** Story-driven RPG adventure

**Speaker Notes:**
Our game is about school adventures - starting on a school bus where players meet 12 different students, each with unique personalities and dialogue. Think Earthbound meets everyday school life. This is a learning project for everyone - kids and adults alike.

---

## SLIDE 3: The Team

**Title:** Meet Our Development Team

**Content:**

**Family 1 - Technical Team** 🔧
- Maps, events, game systems
- Database configuration
- Plugin management

**Family 2 - Art Team** 🎨
- Character sprites

- UI design

**Everyone** ⭐
- Story & dialogue
- Ideas & brainstorming
- Playtesting & feedback

**Suggested Visual:**
Two columns with icons for tech vs art

**Speaker Notes:**
We've divided responsibilities based on our strengths. Family 1 handles technical implementation - building maps, scripting events, managing the game engine. Family 2 focuses on all visual elements - creating characters, environments, UI. But EVERYONE contributes to story, ideas, and testing. This is truly collaborative!

---

## SLIDE 4: What We've Already Done ✅

**Title:** Setup Complete!

**Content:**

✅ **GitHub Repository**
- Version control for the project
- https://github.com/cpr0duct/school-madness

✅ **Discord Server**
- Team communication hub
- Organized channels for dev, art, testing

✅ **Trello Board**
- Task tracking & planning
- Visual workflow management

✅ **Google Drive**
- Cloud storage for large files
- Design documents & backups

✅ **RPG Maker MZ Project**
- Game initialized and ready!

**Suggested Visual:**
Checkmark icons or logos of each tool

**Speaker Notes:**
Before this meeting, we completed ALL the infrastructure setup. We have professional-grade collaboration tools that real game studios use. GitHub manages our code and assets, Discord keeps us in sync, Trello tracks our tasks, and Google Drive handles our documentation and backups.

---

## SLIDE 5: Your Tools - GitHub

**Title:** GitHub - Version Control

**What It Does:**
- Stores all game files in the cloud
- Tracks every change with full history
- Lets us work on different parts simultaneously
- Automatic backup of everything

**How You'll Use It:**
1. Clone the repository (one-time setup)
2. Before working: Run `pull-updates.bat`
3. After working: Run `quick-commit.bat`
4. That's it!

**Repository:** github.com/cpr0duct/school-madness

**Suggested Visual:**
Git branching diagram or GitHub logo

**Speaker Notes:**
GitHub is our central hub. It's like Google Docs but for game development - it tracks every change, who made it, and when. We've created simple scripts so you never need to touch the command line. Just double-click pull-updates before you start work, and quick-commit when you're done.

---

## SLIDE 6: Your Tools - Discord

**Title:** Discord - Team Communication

**Key Channels:**
- **#task-coordination** - Who's working on what RIGHT NOW
- **#project-status** - Progress updates
- **#art-showcase** - Share your creations
- **#github-activity** - Commit notifications
- **#help-needed** - Ask anything!

**Golden Rule:**
⚠️ **Post in #task-coordination BEFORE opening RPG Maker!**

**Why:** Only one person can edit game data at a time

**Suggested Visual:**
Discord logo with channel list

**Speaker Notes:**
Discord is our real-time communication. The MOST IMPORTANT channel is #task-coordination - always post there before opening RPG Maker MZ. This prevents conflicts because RPG Maker doesn't support simultaneous editing. Think of it like reserving the game engine for an hour.

---

## SLIDE 7: Your Tools - Trello

**Title:** Trello - Task Management

**Our Workflow Columns:**
1. **Backlog** - All future tasks
2. **This Week** - Current priorities
3. **Next Up** - Ready to start
4. **In Progress** - Someone's working on it
5. **Review/Testing** - Needs feedback
6. **Done** - Completed!

**How To Use:**
- Pick a card from "Next Up"
- Move it to "In Progress"
- Assign yourself
- Move to "Review" when done

**Suggested Visual:**
Kanban board visualization

**Speaker Notes:**
Trello is our visual task board. Every feature, art asset, or bug is a card. You can see at a glance what everyone's working on. When you finish something, move it to Review so others can test it. We'll do weekly planning sessions to fill "This Week" together.

---

## SLIDE 8: Your Tools - Google Drive

**Title:** Google Drive - Cloud Storage

**What Goes Here:**
- 📄 Design documents
- 🎨 Original art files (.psd, .aseprite)
- 📝 Story & dialogue drafts
- 💾 Weekly project backups
- 🎬 Meeting recordings
- 📸 Reference images

**What Goes in GitHub:**
- Exported game assets
- RPG Maker project files
- Code & plugins

**Suggested Visual:**
Folder tree or Google Drive logo

**Speaker Notes:**
Google Drive stores everything that's too big for GitHub or needs collaborative editing. Your original art files with all the layers? Google Drive. A Google Doc with story outlines? Drive. The exported PNG that goes into the game? That goes in GitHub. Think: Drive for creation, GitHub for the final game.

---

## SLIDE 11: The Daily Workflow

**Title:** How We Work Together

**Before You Start:**
1. Run `pull-updates.bat` (get latest changes)
2. Post in Discord #task-coordination
3. Check Trello for your task

**While Working:**
- Create/edit your assigned files
- Save frequently
- Test your changes

**After You Finish:**
1. Save and close RPG Maker / art tools
2. Run `quick-commit.bat`
3. Enter description of what you did
4. Post in Discord #github-activity

**Suggested Visual:**
Circular workflow diagram

**Speaker Notes:**
This is your daily rhythm. Always pull updates first - this downloads what others did yesterday. Post in Discord so others know what you're doing. Work on your task. When done, commit and tell the team. Simple as that. The scripts automate all the Git complexity.

---

## SLIDE 12: Coordination Rules ⚠️

**Title:** Avoiding Conflicts

**The Golden Rules:**

🚨 **ONE person in RPG Maker at a time**

✅ **What's Safe to Do Simultaneously:**
- Family 1: Edit maps/events
- Family 2: Create NEW art assets
- Anyone: Write docs/story

❌ **What Causes Conflicts:**
- Two people editing same map
- Two people editing database
- Two people editing same art file

**Always communicate in Discord first!**

**Suggested Visual:**
Warning triangle and traffic light (red/green)

**Speaker Notes:**
This is critical. RPG Maker MZ doesn't support multiple people editing at once. If two people change the same map, one person's work gets lost. Always coordinate in Discord. Family 1 can work on game logic while Family 2 creates new sprites - that's fine. But if you want to edit an existing map or character, make sure nobody else is working on it.

---

## SLIDE 13: What We're Building First

**Title:** Phase 1: School Bus Scene

**The First Map:**
- **Setting:** Interior of a school bus
- **Layout:** 6 rows of seats, center aisle
- **NPCs:** 12 unique students
- **Gameplay:** Walk, talk, learn mechanics

**Goals:**
- Introduce players to the game
- Tutorial for controls
- Meet memorable characters
- Set the tone (fun, quirky, relatable)

**Suggested Visual:**
School bus sketch or pixel art mockup

**Speaker Notes:**
Our first development milestone is the school bus interior. This is the opening scene - the player's introduction to our game world. 12 students sit in seats, each with unique personalities and dialogue. Players walk up the aisle, talk to students, and learn basic game mechanics. It's our tutorial AND our first impression.

---

## SLIDE 14: Upcoming Tasks

**Title:** What's Next (First Sprint)

**This Week:**

**Design & Planning** 📋
- Create Game Design Document
- Define the 12 student characters
- Write initial dialogue
- Sketch bus layout

**Art** 🎨
- Decide art style
- Create 4 student sprites
- Design bus tileset

**Technical** 🔧
- Build bus map in RPG Maker

**Suggested Visual:**
Task cards or sprint board

**Speaker Notes:**
These are our immediate next steps. We'll create a Game Design Document that outlines our vision. We need character profiles for all 12 students - names, personalities, quirks. Artists will create sprites. Programmers will build the map and make NPCs interactive. We'll tackle this together over the next 2-3 weeks.

---

## SLIDE 15: The 12 Students

**Title:** Character Brainstorming

**Student Archetypes to Consider:**
